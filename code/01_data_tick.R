### Script to create tidy dataset of NEON tick abundances
# link data from lab and field
# filter out poor quality data
# rectify count issues
# export in tidy format

### Load packages

library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and piping (dplyr probably ok)
library(neonUtilities) # for downloading data (use GitHub version)
library(lubridate) # for finding year from dates
library(stringr)

# If data weren't already downloaded, download full NEON dataset
# As of 7/6/20 loadByProduct had bugs if using the CRAN version of the package
# Downloading the package NeonUtilities via Github solves the issue

###########################################
# NOTES ON GENERAL DATA ISSUES #
###########################################

# Issue 1: the latency between field (30 days) and lab (300 days) is different
# In 2019, tick counts were switched over to the lab instead of the field
# If the samples aren't processed yet, there will be an NA for all the counts (regardless of whether ticks were present)
# Normally if ticks weren't present (targetTaxaPresent == "N) we could feel comfortable assigning all the tick counts a 0 (no ticks)
# In this case, doing that would mean that there are 0s when ticks are absent and NAs when ticks are present
# Yearly trends would show a bias since there are no counts for all the sites with ticks, and 0s when there aren't ticks
# Rather, we should not use those dates until the lab data come in
# Would be good to check with NEON whether the 0s for counts are assigned at the same time the lab data come in?

# Issue 2: larva counts
# larvae were not always counted or ID'd in earlier years
# requiring larval counts to be non-NA will remove records from earlier years

# Issue 3: discrepancies between field counts and lab counts
# Often lab counts are less than field because they stop counting at a certain limit
# This is not always recorded in the same way
# Other times ticks were miscounted or lost on either end
# Probably OK to ignore most minor issues, and make best attempt at more major issues
# Drop remaining records that are confusing

#### Quality Flags
# remove samples that had logistical issues
# keep only those with NA in samplingImpractical 
tck_fielddata %>% filter(is.na(samplingImpractical)|samplingImpractical == "OK") -> tck_fielddata_filtered

#### Remove records with no count data  
# first confirm that lots of the records with no count data are recent years

# note that requiring larval counts to be non na will drop some legacy data


#### Check correspondence between field and lab
# Making the assumption that the user only cares about ID'd ticks and not raw abundances.
# If so, only include field records corresponding to the dates with lab data

# Get rid of field samples that have no taxonomic info 
tck_fielddata_filtered %>% filter(sampleID %in% tck_taxonomyProcessed$sampleID | is.na(sampleID)) -> tck_fielddata_filtered

# check that drags with ticks present have a sample ID
tck_fielddata_filtered %>% filter(targetTaxaPresent == "Y" & is.na(sampleID)) # none are missing S.ID

  filter(is.na(adultCount) & is.na(nymphCount) & is.na(larvaCount)) %>% nrow()

# are there any 0 counts where there should be > 0?
tck_fielddata_filtered %>% filter(targetTaxaPresent == "Y") %>% mutate(totalCount = adultCount + nymphCount + larvaCount) %>% filter(totalCount == 0) # no

### option 2) a sample x species table with only counts, summed by life form
tck_merged_final %>% select(uid_field, acceptedTaxonID, IndividualCount) %>% group_by(uid_field, acceptedTaxonID) %>%

# NOTES FOR END USERS  #
#######################################
# be aware of higher order taxa ID -- they are individuals ASSIGNED at a higher taxonomic class, rather than the sum of lower tax. class
# higher order taxonomic assignments could be semi-identified by looking at most likely ID (e.g. if 200 of 700 larvae are IXOSPAC, very likely that the Unidentified larvae are IXOSPAC)
# unidentified could be changed to IXOSPP across the board 
# All combos of species-lifestage aren't in the long form (e.g. if there were never IXOAFF_Adult, it will be missing instead of 0)
